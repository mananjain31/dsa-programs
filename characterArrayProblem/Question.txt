In c programming,
Without the use of any extra Pre Defined function
except printf() and
Without Using any extra Array we have to:

let input is : "i am manan jain  31 "
output : " 31  jain manan am i"

We can use user defined function

Code:

#include<stdio.h>
//inset lines code below this

//inset lines code above this
int main()
{
	char x[]="i am manan jain  31 ";
//inset lines code below this

//inset lines code above this
	printf("%s\n",x);
	return 0;
}

Expected output : " 31  jain manan am i"

for 
char x[]="   100 hundered"
Expected output : "hundered 100   "
